<strong> Lessons Learned</strong> 
<p>This project taught me a lot about event listeners, DOM Manipulation, and various useful methods such as replace. 
It required a clear understanding of each necessary element- conceptually I divided the javascript for the project between that which contributes towards
making the display dynamic and that which does the math operations. This required me to use variables to store the numbers being operated on, something I hadn't had to consider as much for previous projects.</p>
